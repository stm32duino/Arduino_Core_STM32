-# ArduinoCore-API
+# 📚 ArduinoCore-API for STM32duino
 
-[![Unit Tests](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/workflows/Unit%20Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/actions?workflow=Unit+Tests)

-[![Spell Check status](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/actions/workflows/spell-check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/actions/workflows/spell-check.yml)
+Fork of [`arduino/ArduinoCore-API`](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API)  
+Designed to be used as a git submodule in [`stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32`](https://github.com/stm32duino/Arduino_Core_STM32)
 
-This repository hosts the hardware independent layer of Arduino core. In other words it contains the abstract definition of the Arduino core API, consisting of hardware-independent header files that are then included and implemented by the various platform-specific cores.
+---
 
-Having a single place where the Arduino API is defined means that there is no longer a String implementation within every Arduino core (a String module within ArduinoCore-avr, a String module within ArduinoCore-samd, a String module within ArduinoCore-megaavr …) but rather one String implementation within ArduinoCore-API which all other cores utilise. This has the pleasant side effects that bugs fixed or features added within the ArduinoCore-API String implementation are automatically propagated to all cores utilizing ArduinoCore-API.
+## 🎯 Purpose
 
-As of now, the following official cores are utilising ArduinoCore-API:
+This repository is a fork which reworks the folder structure to contain only the official Arduino API and hardware‑independent code, in order to simplify Arduino API integration into STM32duino via a git submodule.
 
-* [megaavr](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-megaAVR)
-* [mbed](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-mbed)
-* [samd](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-samd)
-* [renesas](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-renesas)
+It will also contain some updates/changes/enhancements/fixes.
 
-There's an ongoing effort to port the others, while maintainers of third-party cores are strongly invited to follow the same route in order to stay up-to-date with the new language features. For backwards compatibility, every revision of this repo will increase the `ARDUINO_API_VERSION` define.
+---
 
-## Documentation
+## 📦 What's Included?
 
-The Arduino API is documented in the official [language reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/), whose sources are located in [this repository](https://github.com/arduino/reference-en) and are open to contributions from the community.
+- ✅ Official Arduino API files (`api/` folder)
+- ✅ some updates, changes, enhancements and fixes.
 
-## Support
+---
 
-This repository is not directly usable by final users. If you need assistance with Arduino, see the [Help Center](https://support.arduino.cc/) and browse the [forum](https://forum.arduino.cc).
+## 🚀 Submodule usage
 
-## Development
+### 1️⃣ Add the Submodule
 
-### Bugs & Issues
+In the `Arduino_Core_STM32` repository, run:
 
-If you want to report an issue with this core, you can submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-API/issues) of this repository. Some rules apply:
-
-* If your issue is about a specific hardware platform, report it to its repository. This one is only about discussing the generic API.
-* Before posting, please check if the same problem has been already reported by someone else to avoid duplicates.
-* Remember to include as much detail as you can about your hardware set-up, code and steps for reproducing the issue. Make sure you're using an original Arduino board.
-
-### Contributions
+```bash
 
-Contributions are always welcome! You can submit them directly to this repository as Pull Requests. Please provide a detailed description of the problem you're trying to solve. We also appreciate any help in testing issues and patches contributed by other users.
+git submodule add https://github.com/stm32duino/ArduinoCore-API.git cores/arduino/api
+```
+### 2️⃣ Initialize and update
+```bash
+git submodule update --init 
+```
 
-### Unit testing
+---
 
-This repository includes a test suite that covers most of the API and that is designed to run on generic hardware, thus not requiring a development board. We call this _host-based unit-testing_. In order to test the features that are only defined but not implemented in this repository, mock implementations are included.
+## 🔗 Official Resources
 
-Please help us improve the coverage of the test suite!

-#### To build and run unit tests
+---
 
-The unit tests are automatically built by GitHub as part of pull request checks (in `.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml`).
+## 📝 License
 
-To build and run locally:
+This repository is a fork of `arduino/ArduinoCore-API` and maintains the **same license** (LGPL 2.1+).
 
-**Dependencies**
+See the [LICENSE](License) file in the repository root for details.
 
-* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
-* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/)

-On (Ubuntu) Linux run:
+## 💡 Important Notes
 
-```bash
-sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
-```
+### ✅ Advantages of Using a Submodule
 
-From the project root:
+- **Traceability**: Know exactly which version of the API you're using
+- **Easy Updates**: Simple `git submodule update` to sync
+- **Isolation**: API stays in its own code branch
+- **Compatibility**: STM32-specific modifications remain separate
 
-```bash
-cd test && mkdir build && cd build
-cmake ..
-make && bin/test-ArduinoCore-API
-```
+### ⚠️ Points to Consider
 
-### Implementing ArduinoCore-API
+- After cloning **Arduino_Core_STM32**, run:
+  ```bash
+  git submodule update --init --recursive
+  ```
 
-In order to compile a core which is implementing ArduinoCore-API you'll need to copy/symlink the `api` directory to the target's `cores/arduino` directory as part of your development and release workflow. The most elegant and effective solution is to develop your core with `api` symlinked and produce the distributable archive by telling `tar` to follow symlinks. Example:
+---
 
-```bash
-tar --exclude='*.git*' -cjhvf $yourcore-$version.tar.bz2 $yourcore/
-```
+## 📊 Project Information
 
-The API is coded to the C++11 standard and the core's compiler must be able to support that version of the language.
