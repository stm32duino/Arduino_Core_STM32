/*
 * Below, support for re-attaching to USB is handled. USB-attachment is
 * detected by the presence of a pullup on one of the USB datalines.
 *
 * To force the USB host to re-enumerate, we must detach (disable
 * pullup), wait a bit, and re-attach (enable pullup). This can be done
 * while running, but must also happen at startup (including the detach
 * and delay, since USB might have been active just before reset, so we
 * must force a re-enumeration). On a cold boot (e.g. USB just plugged
 * in), the forced detach might not be needed, but will not be harmful
 * either.
 *
 * For pullup control, a number of cases are supported:
 *  1. An external pullup controllable through a GPIO (e.g. using an
 *     external transistor). The default output state (e.g. when the
 *     GPIO is floating) can be enabled or disabled, and the output
 *     polarity can be configured.
 *  2. A pullup built into the chip's USB core. This is automatically
 *     enabled by hardware or USB HAL code, and can be manually
 *     controlled using HAL functions.
 *  3. A fixed (always enabled) external pullup. To still allow detaching,
 *     a bit of a hack is used: By setting the D+ to OUTPUT LOW, it
 *     *looks* like the pullup is removed (the host has own, bigger,
 *     pulldown, to detect detaching, so writing LOW looks the same).
 *     This probably violates USB specifications, but does seem to work
 *     well in practice. It probably also should only be used briefly,
 *     keeping the pin OUTPUT LOW for longer might be problematic.
 *
 * These scenarios are considered in order: If the variant defines an
 * external pullup control pin, it is used, else if an internal pullup
 * is present, that is used, else the D+ trick is used.
 *
 * To configure #1, the variant should either define USBD_ATTACH_PIN and
 * USBD_ATTACH_LEVEL when the pullup is disabled by default and the pin
 * can be used to *attach*, or USBD_DETACH_PIN and USBD_DETACH_LEVEL
 * when the pullup is enabled by default and the pin can be used to
 * *detach*.
