/*
  ButtonMouseControl

  For STM32 based board with USB capabilities

  Controls the mouse from five pushbuttons.

  Hardware:
  - five pushbuttons attached to D2, D3, D4, D5, D6

  The mouse movement is always relative. This sketch reads four pushbuttons,
  and uses them to set the movement of the mouse.

  WARNING: When you use the Mouse.move() command, the Arduino takes over your
  mouse! Make sure you have control before you use the mouse commands.

// set pin numbers for the five buttons:
const int upButton = 2;
const int downButton = 3;
const int leftButton = 4;
const int rightButton = 5;
const int mouseButton = 6;

int range = 5;              // output range of X or Y movement; affects movement speed
int responseDelay = 10;     // response delay of the mouse, in ms


void setup() {
  // initialize the buttons' inputs:
  pinMode(upButton, INPUT);
  pinMode(downButton, INPUT);
  pinMode(leftButton, INPUT);
  pinMode(rightButton, INPUT);
  pinMode(mouseButton, INPUT);
  // initialize mouse control:
  Mouse.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // read the buttons:
  int upState = digitalRead(upButton);
  int downState = digitalRead(downButton);
  int rightState = digitalRead(rightButton);
  int leftState = digitalRead(leftButton);
  int clickState = digitalRead(mouseButton);

  // calculate the movement distance based on the button states:
  int  xDistance = (leftState - rightState) * range;
  int  yDistance = (upState - downState) * range;

  // if X or Y is non-zero, move:
  if ((xDistance != 0) || (yDistance != 0)) {
    Mouse.move(xDistance, yDistance, 0);
  }

  // if the mouse button is pressed:
  if (clickState == HIGH) {
    // if the mouse is not pressed, press it:
    if (!Mouse.isPressed(MOUSE_LEFT)) {
      Mouse.press(MOUSE_LEFT);
    }
  }
  // else the mouse button is not pressed:
  else {
    // if the mouse is pressed, release it:
    if (Mouse.isPressed(MOUSE_LEFT)) {
      Mouse.release(MOUSE_LEFT);
    }
  }

  // a delay so the mouse doesn't move too fast:
  delay(responseDelay);
