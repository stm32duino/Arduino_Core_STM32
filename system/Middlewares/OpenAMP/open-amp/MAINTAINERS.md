# OpenAMP Maintainers

The OpenAMP project is maintained by the OpenAMP open source
community. Everyone is encouraged to submit issues and changes to
improve OpenAMP.

The intention of this file is to provide a set of names that developers
can consult when they have a question about OpenAMP and to provide a
set of names to be CC'd when submitting a patch.
