## Overview of the STM32Cube MCU offer on GitHub

**STM32Cube** is an original initiative by STMicroelectronics to **simplify** prototyping and development by **reducing** effort, time, and cost. It supports the entire ARM™ Cortex-based STM32 microcontroller portfolio and provides a **comprehensive** software solution including:
  * The CMSIS Core and Device interfaces enabling access to processor core features and device-specific peripherals of STM32 microcontrollers.
  * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
  * The BSP drivers enabling access to peripherals on the STM32 development boards, external to the microcontroller itself.
  * A consistent set of middleware libraries offering standardized, high-level functionalities — such as USB, TCP/IP, file systems, and graphics.
  * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) that showcase specific functionalities or use cases, and provided with support for multiple IDEs.

The **STM32Cube embedded software** is available in two flavors:
  * The **MCU Firmware** _monolithic_ offer, where **all** software components (Drivers, Middleware, Projects, Utilities) are included in a **single** repository for each STM32 series.
  * The **MCU Software Components** _modular_ offer, where **each** software component (mainly Drivers and Middleware) is provided in a **dedicated** repository, allowing users to **select** only the components they need.

The complete list of repositories is available [here](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32Cube_MCU_Overall_Offer/blob/master/README.md#content).
